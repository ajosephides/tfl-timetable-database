# TFL timetable database creator
This is a little project to build a database of timetables from each stop to another on the London TFL tube network.
The goal was to practise some ruby, well learn - with the aim of using this database for another application.

The program uses the TFL api and so user credentials must be created.

To run from base directory:
```ruby -I ./lib/ bin/main.rb```
